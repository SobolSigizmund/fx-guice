=================================================================== README =====

  This library provides some useful classees that help you integrate
    Google Guice into your JavaFX2 based applications.

  The idea for that class was born after I read an article on
    fxexperience.com (http://fxexperience.com/2011/10/fxml-guice/).
    Therefore,... credits go to `Richard Bair´ for the initial idea.

  A compiled and ready-to-use version of this library can be found in the
    Sonatype OSS Maven Repository (oss.sonatype.org). To use the library
    in your maven based projects just add the following lines to your
    `pom.xml´:

      <dependency>
        <groupId>com.cathive.fx</groupId>
        <artifactId>fx-guice</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
      </dependency>

  In your project all you need to do is create an application class 
    that extends `com.cathive.fx.guice.GuiceApplication´ instead of the
    `javafx.application.Application´ class that ships with JavaFX.

  Next step: instead of using `javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader´ to load FXML files
    you use `com.cathive.fx.guice.GuiceFXMLLoader´... that's basically it!
