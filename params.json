{"name":"CathiveFX Guice","tagline":"Google Guice integration for JavaFX applications","body":"This library provides some useful classes that help you integrate\r\nGoogle Guice into your JavaFX2 based applications.\r\n\r\nThe idea for that class was born after I read an article on\r\nfxexperience.com (http://fxexperience.com/2011/10/fxml-guice/).\r\nTherefore,... credits go to 'Richard Bair' for the initial idea.\r\n\r\nA compiled and ready-to-use version of this library can be found in the\r\nSonatype OSS Maven Repository (oss.sonatype.org). To use the library\r\nin your Maven based projects just add the following lines to your\r\n'pom.xml':\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<dependency>\r\n  <groupId>com.cathive.fx</groupId>\r\n  <artifactId>fx-guice</artifactId>\r\n  <version>2.0.0</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn your project all you need to do is create an application class \r\nthat extends `com.cathive.fx.guice.GuiceApplication` instead of the\r\n`javafx.application.Application` class that ships with JavaFX.\r\n\r\nNext step: instead of using `javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader` to load FXML files\r\nyou use `com.cathive.fx.guice.GuiceFXMLLoader`... that's basically it!\r\n","google":"UA-37475496-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
